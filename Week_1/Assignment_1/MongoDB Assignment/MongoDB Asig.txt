Create a collection called ‘games’. We’re going to put some games in it. 

    Add 5 games to the database. 
            a) Give each document the following properties:
    name, genre, rating (out of 100)
    If you make some mistakes and want to clean it out, use remove()on your
    collection. 
    Write a query that returns all the games 
    Write a query to find one of your games by name without using limit(). 
    Write a query that returns the 3 highest rated games. 
    F. (6 marks) Update your two favorite games to have two achievements called ‘Game
    Master’ and ‘Speed Demon’, each under a single key. Show two ways to do this. 
      Write a query that returns all the games that have both the ‘Game Maser’ and
    the ‘Speed Demon’ achievements. 
    Write a query that returns only games that have achievements. Not all of your
    games should have achievements, obviously.
